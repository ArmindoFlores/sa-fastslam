# Autonomous Systems Project (2021-2022)

## Goal
The goal of this project is to implement the FastSLAM algorithm to enable a TurtleBot robot to map a room by itself using laser scans.

## C++ Version
To build the C++ version you will need the OpenCV library installed. Additionally, Boost is required to run the test program to parse JSON in the input file. [Here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) are the instructions on how to install OpenCV and [here](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) is the same fot Boost.
